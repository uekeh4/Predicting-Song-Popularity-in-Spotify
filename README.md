# Analyzing the Factors that Influence a Song's Popularity
### The Data
Our project uses a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, featuring 943 of the most famous songs from Spotify's 2023 charts. The dataset includes 24 variables, which can be categorized into three main groups:

- __Song Details:__ Track name, artist name(s), artist count, and release date (year, month, day).

- __Streaming Success Metrics:__ Number of Spotify streams, playlist inclusions on Spotify, and chart presence/rank on Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, and Shazam.

- __Audio Features:__ Quantitative measures of a song's attributes such as beats per minute (BPM), danceability, valence, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveliness, and speechiness, as measured by Spotify's audio intelligence. The song's mode (major/minor) and key are also included.

### Visualizations
We created several visualizations to explore trends within the dataset:

- __Top 20 Artists by Song Count:__ A bar chart revealing the artists with the most songs on the charts.

- __Correlation Heatmap:__ A heatmap displaying the correlation between the numeric variables. Most correlations were found to be relatively weak.

- __Distribution of Streams by Key:__ A boxplot illustrating the distribution of stream counts across different musical keys. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test found no significant difference in streams based on a song's key.

### Objectives
The primary goal of this project was to determine what constitutes a hit song. We aimed to:

1. __Analyze__ the characteristics and audio features of successful songs from 2023.

2. __Uncover__ recurring patterns and factors that influence music popularity.

3. __Predict__ a song's success (measured by streams) using various song attributes.

4. __Formulate__ recommendations for artists and record labels on how to create and release a hit song.


### Exploratory Analysis Statistics
- __Most Frequent Artist:__ Taylor Swift was identified as the most frequent artist in the dataset, followed by Bad Bunny and SZA.

- __Streams by Key:__ An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to check for differences in stream counts across different keys. The test yielded a **p-value of 0.668**, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, indicating no statistically significant difference in stream counts based on the song's key.

### Model Performance and Outcomes

- __Decision Tree and Random Forest MSE:__ The initial decision tree model had an **MSE of 478.45**, which only slightly improved to 475.4 after pruning. The random forest model, despite using various `mtry` values, had a best performance of an **MSE of 423.39**. Both were considered too high for the final analysis.

- __LASSO vs. Ridge Regression:__ The report notes that **LASSO had a lower test mean squared error (MSE) than Ridge regression**, leading to the selection of LASSO for variable selection.

- __Best Model Selection:__ After comparing several models using Best, Forward, and Backward Subset Selection, the six-variable model was chosen as the most effective.

- __Adjusted R-squared:__ The six-variable model had an adjusted **R-squared value of 0.4952**. This means that the variables in the model collectively explain approximately 49.52% of the variation in the normalized stream counts.

- __Coefficient Direction:__ The analysis indicates the following relationships with streams:

  - **Speechiness:** Has a negative effect, meaning an increase in a song's speechiness is associated with a decrease in streams.

  - **Danceability:** Has a positive effect, meaning higher danceability is associated with an increase in streams.

  - **Artist Count:** Has a negative impact, which suggests that increasing the number of artists does not necessarily lead to more streams.

  - **Playlist Presence:** Has a positive impact, indicating that songs in more playlists tend to have higher stream counts.

  - **Release Timing:** Songs released later in the year tend to have higher streams.

### Outcome
We attempted to predict a song's streams using several supervised learning methods.

- __Decision Trees & Random Forests:__ Both models had a very high Mean Squared Error (MSE), indicating they were not a good fit for our data. The random forest model, despite - being more robust, still performed poorly, likely due to the non-linear nature of the data.

- __Linear Regression:__ We transformed the `streams` variable using the Box-Cox method to normalize the data. We then used LASSO, Ridge Regression, and Subset Selection methods (Best, Forward, and Backward) to find the best-performing linear model.

- __Final Model:__ The six-variable linear regression model had the lowest residual standard error and highest adjusted R-squared value (0.4952), making it the most effective model.

The model's key findings were:

- __Positive Impact:__ Higher danceability and presence in Spotify playlists positively impact a song's streams. Songs released later in the year also tended to have more streams.

- __Negative Impact:__ Higher speechiness (more lyrics) and an increased artist count were negatively associated with stream counts. This contradicts some industry beliefs and prior research on artist collaborations.

- __Model Limitations:__ The model accounts for only 49.52% of the variation in streams, indicating that a significant portion of a song's success is influenced by factors not included in our analysis, such as marketing, social media virality, and artist popularity.
### Model Visualizations

#### Distribution of Normalized Streams
This histogram shows the frequency of normalized stream counts. The green bars display a roughly symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution, confirming the successful transformation of the original data for use in our linear model.

#### Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals
This plot assesses whether the model's residuals follow a normal distribution. While the points largely align with the red line, their deviation at the ends indicates that the distribution's tails are heavier than expected, suggesting the presence of outliers.

#### Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot
This plot displays the residuals against the fitted values to check for patterns. The points do not generally cluster around the red line at zero, which is indicative of heterodasticity. Some outliers and a slightly downward trend suggest potential issues with the model's assumptions.
